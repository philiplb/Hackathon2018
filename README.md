# Develco Hackathon Kit #

## Introduction ##

This is the Hackathon Kit for the first Geeny Hackathon. It's a simple NodeJS app
that reads and _publishes_ (TODO) message-streams from Geeny. This sample is intended
as initial Boilerplate template to easily get started with Develco messages. This
README is self-contained documentation about how to get started with this project.

# Step 0. Get yourself a Developer Account.

We are making things super simple for the Hackathon. No worries about onboarding
users. Use *ONE* user to setup the formulas and elements ahead.

# First Step. Setup Home-Smart-Home.

## Pairing/Login to your Gateway

Pairing the Develco devices is done by accessing the Develco Gateway.
First, go to the IP of your gateway:

[Your IP]:8000/

You'll need the serial number of the device to access the device.
For easy copy/paste:

```

| Door Sensor   | 0015 BC00 1E00 337D   |
| Smart Plug    | 0015 BC00 2F00 1036   |
| LED Bulb      | 0015 8D00 0150 B4A1   |
| Flood Alarm   | 0015 BC00 3300 041C   |
| Smoke Alarm   | 0015 BC00 3100 1640   |
| Temp/Humidity | 0015 BC00 3500 03A1   |
| Motion Sensor | 0015 BC00 1A00 623A   |
```

### Tip:

Remove batteries to force restart of the sensor and get faster pairing. For
wall-powered sensors, plug-unplug.

# Deploying This Boilerplate Example

1. Clone this repository `git@prod01-gitlab01.geeny.local:developers/HackathonKit.git`

2. Refer to the [staging
   docs](http://test-docs.geeny.io.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/getting-started/formulas/step-2/)
   to see how the deployment works

### Tip:

Edit the `build_and_push.sh` and set your key for easy deployments.
